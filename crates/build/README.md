Automated security decision-making under uncertainty.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build

The build crate is responsible for building Bulwark's plugins.

## üè∞ What is Bulwark?

Bulwark is a fast, modern, open-source web application firewall (WAF) and API security gateway. It simplifies the
implementation of detective security controls while offering comprehensive visibility into your web services. Bulwark's
detection-as-code approach to rule definition offers security teams higher confidence in their response to persistent
and adaptive threats. Bulwark plugins offer a wide range of capabilities, enabling security teams to define and evolve
detections rapidly, without making changes to the underlying application.

## üöÄ Quickstart

Bulwark plugins are compiled to WebAssembly before use. While it's recommended to do this using a workflow like
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), you can also do this manually, particularly for development.
Most users will want to use the Bulwark CLI to build their plugins. The CLI uses this library as a dependency.

To compile a Bulwark plugin with the CLI (after installing the CLI with `cargo install bulwark-cli`):

```bash
bulwark-cli build -p rules/example-plugin -o dist/plugins/
```

In some cases, you may want to compile a plugin without the CLI, such as within a test case.

```rust
bulwark_build::build_plugin(
    base.join("path/to/plugin"),            // input directory
    base.join("dist/plugins/plugin.wasm"),  // output file
    &[],                                    // no additional compiler args
    true,                                   // install missing targets if needed
)?;
```

## üí™ Contributing

Check out the list of [open issues](https://github.com/bulwark-security/bulwark/issues). We actively maintain a
list of [issues suitable for new contributors][good-first-issue] to the project. Alternatively, detection plugins
may be contributed to the [community ruleset](https://github.com/bulwark-security/bulwark-community-ruleset).

We do not require contributors to sign a license agreement (CLA) because we want users of Bulwark to be confident
that the software will remain available under its current license.
