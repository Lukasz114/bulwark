Automated security decision-making under uncertainty.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config

The configuration crate is responsible for parsing Bulwark's configuration files and representing setting values
throughout the application.

This crate does not yet have a useful function outside of its use as a dependency of `bulwark-cli`.

## üè∞ What is Bulwark?

Bulwark is a fast, modern, open-source web application firewall (WAF) and API security gateway. It simplifies the
implementation of detective security controls while offering comprehensive visibility into your web services. Bulwark's
detection-as-code approach to rule definition offers security teams higher confidence in their response to persistent
and adaptive threats. Bulwark plugins offer a wide range of capabilities, enabling security teams to define and evolve
detections rapidly, without making changes to the underlying application.

## üí™ Contributing

Check out the list of [open issues](https://github.com/bulwark-security/bulwark/issues). We actively maintain a
list of [issues suitable for new contributors][good-first-issue] to the project. Alternatively, detection plugins
may be contributed to the [community ruleset](https://github.com/bulwark-security/bulwark-community-ruleset).

We do not require contributors to sign a license agreement (CLA) because we want users of Bulwark to be confident
that the software will remain available under its current license.
