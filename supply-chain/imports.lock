The optimization to use `buffer.set_len(buffer.capacity())` in `command_helpers::StderrForwarder::forward_available`
doesn't look panic-safe: if `stderr.read` panics and that panic is caught by a caller of `forward_available`, then
the inner buffer of `StderrForwarder` will contain uninitialized data. This looks difficult to trigger in practice,
but I have opened an issue <https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs/issues/1036>.

`parallel::async_executor` contains `unsafe` pinning code but it looks reasonable. Similarly for the `unsafe`
initialization code in `parallel::job_token::JobTokenServer` and file operations in `parallel::stderr`.

This crate executes commands, and my review is likely not sufficient to detect subtle backdoors.
I did not review the use of library handles in the `com` package on Windows.
